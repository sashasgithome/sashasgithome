I'm an undergraduate intern who is deeply intrigued in computer-based language processing and is familiar by experience with Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, even Business Analytics.

### ðŸ¤– Experience ðŸ’¼
With my current job role related to AI, I am confident to

- research, expand, and develop projects with concepts like LLM, Knowledge Graph, and RAG
- understand and utilize libraries related to ML and DL tasks most optimally, some such as LangChain, Pytorch, Tensorflow, and Matplotlib. 

Feel free to reach me for any interesting projects!
